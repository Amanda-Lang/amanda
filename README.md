# Amanda
Implementation of a tree walk intepreter for a language designed for educational purposes.
Amanda is directed at portuguese speakers who are just getting into programming and don't have knowledge of the english language.
Since Amanda is based on portuguese, it's user will be able to get a used to it much easier than if they had started with
a more traditional GPL (most of them are english based on english).
