# Amanda

Amanda is a statically typed programming language with portuguese constructs. 
It is implemented using a tree walk intepreter and was mainly made to help me get a feel for progamming language design and implementation. 
You can't do much with it due to it's slowness and lack of more expressive features.

## Usage

*TODO: Make instructions better*
*TODO: Add PT version of this lool*

**On Windows**
To run the interpreter on Windows, download and install python 3.0 or higher from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and
then run the following command in the project folder:

```
python -m amanda FILE 
```

Replace 'FILE' with the path to an amanda file. You can run the "hello world.ama" with the following command:

```
python -m amanda examples/hello_word.ama 
```

**On Linux** 
You probably already have python installed so just run the pyamanda script in the main directory of the project
with the following command:

```
pyamanda FILE
```

Replace 'FILE' with the path to an amanda file. You can run the "hello world.ama" with the following command:

```
pyamanda examples/hello_word.ama 
```

If the script doesn't work just run the same command as in windows replacing 'python' with your python 3 binary
(usually python3).
